# Competitions

Create a machine learning competition for your organization, friends or the world!

There are two types of competitions you can create:

- generic: a competition where you provide the data and the participants provide the predictions as a CSV file. all the test data is always available to the participants.

- script: a competition where you provide the data and the participants provide the code that generates the predictions. test data can be hidden from the participants.

You can choose to make your competition public or private. Public competitions are visible to everyone and anyone can participate. Private competitions are only visible to the people you invite!
