# Pricing

Creating a competition is free. However, you will need to pay for the compute resources used to run the competition. The cost of the compute resources depends the type of competition you create.

- generic: generic competitions are free to run. you can, however, upgrade the compute to cpu-upgrade to speed up the metric calculation and reduce the waiting time for the participants.

- script: script competitions require a compute resource to run the participant's code. you can choose between a variety of cpu and gpu instances (T4, A10g and even A100). the cost of the compute resource is charged per hour.

For information on the cost of the compute resources, please see the [pricing page](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#hardware-resources).
