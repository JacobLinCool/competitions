# Understanding the leaderboard

There are two types of leaderboards for all competitions:

- Public Leaderboard: This leaderboard is calculated on X% of the test dataset, and is what you see on the competition page all the time.
The value of X will be mentioned in the problem statement by the organizers.

- Private Leaderboard: This leaderboard is calculated on the remaining (100-X)% of the test dataset, and is made public only after the competition is over.
Your final ranking is based on the private leaderboard.

When you make a submission, both the public and private leaderboard scores are calculated but only the public leaderboard score is displayed.
When a competition is over, the private leaderboard score is revealed and the final rankings are calculated based on that.
You can select N submissions to be considered for the private leaderboard score calculation.
The value of N will be mentioned in the problem statement by the organizers.
